# Modeling Application

## Overview
The Modeling Application is a Java program designed to facilitate modeling and analysis tasks. It provides functionality for running models specified in Java classes and executing scripts to analyze and manipulate data associated with these models. The application offers both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with and visualize modeling results.

## Java Techniques Utilized

1. **File Handling**: Reading data from files using `Files.readAllLines()` and `BufferedReader`, and writing data to files using `FileWriter`.

2. **Exception Handling**: Implementation of exception handling using `try-catch` blocks to handle file reading errors and other potential exceptions.

3. **Collections Framework**: Effective usage of Java's Collections Framework, including `Map` and `List`, for storing and manipulating data.

4. **Regular Expressions**: Utilization of regular expressions (`Pattern` and `Matcher`) for pattern matching and text manipulation tasks.

5. **Reflection**: Dynamic invocation of methods and access to fields of classes at runtime using Java Reflection API (`Class.forName()`, `Field`, `Method`).

6. **Annotations**: Creation and usage of custom annotations (`@Bind`) to mark fields in model classes for binding with data.

7. **Swing GUI**: Design and implementation of a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing components (`JFrame`, `JPanel`, `JButton`, `JTable`, `JList`, `JTextArea`) for user interaction and data visualization.

8. **Event Handling**: Handling user events (e.g., button clicks) using event listeners (`ActionListener`) to trigger corresponding actions in the application.

9. **Multithreading**: Utilization of Swing's event dispatch thread (EDT) to ensure proper concurrency and responsiveness of the GUI application.

10. **Groovy Scripting**: Integration of Groovy scripting language (`GroovyShell`) for executing ad hoc scripts and performing dynamic data manipulation.
