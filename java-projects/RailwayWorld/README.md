# Railway World Simulation

The Railway World Simulation is a Java-based project that simulates the operations of a railway system. It provides a virtual environment to explore various aspects of railway management, including train movement, cargo transportation, station operations, and handling of hazards.

## Main Features

- **Train Simulation:** The project simulates the movement of trains along predefined routes, considering factors such as speed control, station stops, and distance calculations.

- **Railroad Car Types:** Different types of railroad cars are modeled, including basic freight cars, refrigerated cars for perishable goods, restaurant cars for passenger dining, and cars for transporting toxic materials.

- **Multithreading:** Multithreading techniques are utilized to simulate concurrent activities within the railway system, such as train movement, cargo loading and unloading, and station operations.

- **Exception Handling:** The project incorporates exception handling mechanisms to deal with exceptional situations, such as overloading of trains, hazards on the railway, or errors during simulation.

- **Randomization:** Random number generation is used to introduce randomness into various aspects of the simulation, such as selecting cargo types, determining seating capacities, or simulating delays.

- **Data Structures:** Data structures like lists are employed to manage collections of objects, such as trains, railroad cars, stations, and queues of waiting trains.
