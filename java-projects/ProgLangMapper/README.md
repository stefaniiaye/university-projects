# ProgLang Mapper

## Project Description
ProgLang Mapper is a Java application designed to map programming languages to programmers and vice versa. It reads data from a tab-separated values (TSV) file containing information about programming languages and the programmers who use them. The application then provides functionality to map languages to programmers and programmers to languages based on the provided data. It implements various Java techniques and features to achieve its functionality.

## Java Techniques Utilized

1. **File Handling**: Reading data from a TSV file using `FileReader` and `BufferedReader`.
   
2. **Exception Handling**: Implementation of exception handling using `try-catch` blocks to handle file reading errors.

3. **Collections Framework**: Effective usage of Java's Collections Framework, including `Map` and `List`, for storing and manipulating data.

4. **Stream API**: Utilization of Java Stream API for processing and manipulating data streams efficiently, particularly for splitting and processing file content.

5. **Lambda Expressions**: Deployment of lambda expressions to provide concise and functional implementations of functional interfaces, such as `Predicate` and `Comparator`.

6. **Functional Interfaces**: Usage of Java's functional interfaces like `Predicate` and `Comparator` to define and implement functions as data types.

7. **Java I/O**: Management of input and output streams, as well as file handling operations, using Java I/O classes like `FileReader`, `BufferedReader`, and `FileWriter`.

8. **Generics**: Effective use of generics to create flexible and reusable data structures and methods that can work with different types.

9. **Java 8 Features**: Adoption of Java 8 features such as lambda expressions, functional interfaces, and the Stream API to write concise and expressive code.

10. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Designing the project using object-oriented principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, to create modular and maintainable code.
